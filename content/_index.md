title: "About Me"

My name is Alexandra Hartman. I am a Professor of Political Science and 
Public Policy at University College London (UCL).

I study the relationship between marginalized social groups and the state 
with a focus on property rights and displacement status.  I use RCTs, 
survey experiments, micro-level data, and in-depth field research to 
understand when and how empowerment is successful.

I am thankful for the support of The National Science Foundation, The 
Norwegian Refugee Council, EGAP, ELRHA, Landesa, DfID, UNHCR, USAID, The 
International Growth Centre, UCL  and Yale University. My work has been 
published or is forthcoming in PNAS, International Organization, The 
Journal of Conflict Resolution, The Journal of Politics, The British 
Journal of Political Science, The Journal of Peace Research, and The 
American Political Science Review.
